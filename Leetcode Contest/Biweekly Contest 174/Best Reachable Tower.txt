Leetcode problem number : 3809
Level : medium

Problem Statement:

You are given a 2D integer array towers, where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] represents the coordinates (xi, yi) and quality factor qi of the ith tower.
You are also given an integer array center = [cx, cy​​​​​​​] representing your location, and an integer radius.
A tower is reachable if its Manhattan distance from center is less than or equal to radius.

Among all reachable towers:

Return the coordinates of the tower with the maximum quality factor.
If there is a tie, return the tower with the lexicographically smallest coordinate. If no tower is reachable, return [-1, -1].
The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
A coordinate [xi, yi] is lexicographically smaller than [xj, yj] if xi < xj, or xi == xj and yi < yj.
|x| denotes the absolute value of x.

Key Logic while solving: 

A tower is reachable if its Manhattan distance from center is <= radius.

Among reachable towers:

Choose the one with maximum quality factor.

If there is a tie, choose the lexicographically smallest (x, y).

If no tower is reachable, return [-1, -1].

Time Complexity

O(n) — single pass through all towers.

O(1) extra space.
